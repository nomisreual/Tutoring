# Tutoring DCI EO8

This repository is aimed at classmates participating in my tutoring sessions accompanying the main course at Digital Career Institute.

## Where to find what:

There are two top-level directories: *Preparation* and *Sessions*.

All the material for reviewing after a session is stored in the *Sessions* folder. In *Preparation* I keep track files I prepare for sessions, but of course you can have a peek.
